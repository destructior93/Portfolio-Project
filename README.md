This project includes 2 SQL files.

The first SQL file is a brief study and exploration of data of the COVID-19 virus using SQL.
It includes selecting and highlighting a few types of data, as well as usage of CTE's and temp tables as well as preparing data for visualization.

The second is focused on cleaning, standardizing and formatting a table of housing information.
Examples are: joining tables, populating and clearing cells, removing duplicates, ect.

Both projects were made by me while following @AlexTheAnalyst's tutorial series. Shout out to both him and freecodecamp.org for their great contributions!
